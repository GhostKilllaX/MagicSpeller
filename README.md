# MagicSpeller üßô‚Äç

**Solver for the Discord puzzle game SpellCast.**

## Installing

To use MagicSpeller, head to the [release page](https://github.com/GhostKilllaX/MagicSpeller/releases) and download the
latest pre compiled program or build the project yourself.

## Features

* **Fast**. Multithreading and C#.
* **Easy to use**. Uses image processing algorithms to process the game board from your current screen.
* **Different output formats.** You can select between simple, with a table (like in the example) and json output.

## How it works

* After starting the executable, you can either input the game board by hand or let the program analyze your current  
  screen and find the game board by itself.
* For the image analyzing, the program uses the OpenCV library and basically searches for the biggest square.
  So make sure no other big squares exist lol
* After entering the board the program will search for the best word with no, one and two swaps and prints the result
  to the console.

For example, if you want to call this solver from another process, you could call it like
"MagicSpeller.exe --input Screenshot --format Json --output File result.json" and process the json file further.
